# hydrangea-hackathon
This is the project my team made during my first hackathon. We built a game to help our peers with mental health and stress.

Our team all related to having stress and feeling overwhelmed throughout the pandemic. After researching the best ways to relieve stress, we found that taking a break and doing a calming activity is one of the top methods. Wanting to address this with our project, we created a game that gives users a chance to destress and relax from their stressors. 

Users use the arrow keys to draw anything they want to and may use different colors to represent how well their day was today. We also incorporated ML as an extra feature which takes the drawing and compares it to another image the computer finds similar to it. 

I pitched in this project with making the introductions section and fixing bugs.
